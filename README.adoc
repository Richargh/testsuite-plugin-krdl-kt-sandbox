= Testsuites Gradle Library (Sandbox)

In 2010 Simon Stewart, Google Test Engineer, wrote that they categorize tests into link:https://testing.googleblog.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html[small, medium and large].
This repository shows how to split tests into these three categories with gradle.
An older approach via the community test suite plugin can be found on link:https://github.com/Richargh/testsets-plugin-krdl-kt-sandbox[Github].

*Features*

* Multi-project
* Small, Medium, Large Test suites via official but incubating link:https://docs.gradle.org/8.4/userguide/jvm_test_suite_plugin.html[Gradle JVM Test Suite Plugin]
* Shared Test Fixtures via official link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#sec:java_test_fixtures[Gradle JVM Test Fixtures Plugin]

== Usage

* Build and run all tests: `./gradlew build`
* Run all tests: `./gradlew check`

You can play around by enabling, disabling or changing tags of tests.
